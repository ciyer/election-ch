# Purpose
Repo for the Election Hackdays organized by opendata.ch

# Project
Determine if there is a correlation between income and voting patterns within ZH.

# Data Sources
I use the following data sources that were presented in the hackdays:

1. https://github.com/srfdata/2015-06-elections-partystrengths
2. http://www.statistik.zh.ch/internet/justiz_inneres/statistik/de/daten/gemeindeportraet_kanton_zuerich.html#a-content

The first data sources captures the amount of votes captured by each party in each municipality in Switzerland, The second provides information on income and wealth for each municipality in ZÃ¼rich.

# Implementation

The implementation here is in python and uses data analytics packages like numpy and pandas. To run the code, you may need to install some modules in your python environment.
